NOTE:
to make this assignment compile on 64 bit linux one has to install gcc-multilib
and libexpat1-dev:i386 packages.
Then it will compile and - run.
This took 4 days and a lot of nerves as I was trying to install 32 bit OS
on UEFI.
As it did not work out I tried VirtualBox and had countless new 
problems there.
Madness.
ENDNOTE.



For those of you in need of a hash function for strings,
you can use the following, which is lifted from a textbook
we used to use in CS106A.  You'll need to modify it so that
it can be used by a hashset to store C strings (or structs
keyed on C strings).

/** 
 * StringHash                     
 * ----------  
 * This function adapted from Eric Roberts' "The Art and Science of C"
 * It takes a string and uses it to derive a hash code, which   
 * is an integer in the range [0, numBuckets).  The hash code is computed  
 * using a method called "linear congruence."  A similar function using this     
 * method is described on page 144 of Kernighan and Ritchie.  The choice of                                                     
 * the value for the kHashMultiplier can have a significant effect on the                            
 * performance of the algorithm, but not on its correctness.                                                    
 * This hash function has the additional feature of being case-insensitive,  
 * hashing "Peter Pawlowski" and "PETER PAWLOWSKI" to the same code.  
 */  

static const signed long kHashMultiplier = -1664117991L;
static int StringHash(const char *s, int numBuckets)  
{            
  int i;
  unsigned long hashcode = 0;
  
  for (i = 0; i < strlen(s); i++)  
    hashcode = hashcode * kHashMultiplier + tolower(s[i]);  
  
  return hashcode % numBuckets;                                
}

This quarter, we're going with an industrial strength version that
relies on the expat XML parser.  The expat parser is a stream-based
parser than reads in XML files, invoking user-supplied callback
functions every time is encounters a start tag (like <item> or
<description>), and end tag (like </item> or </link>), or character
data (which, of course, is the visible, readable content of an XML
document or an HTML page.)

I do virtually all of the XML parsing for you.

You'll notice that the ProcessEndTag is the function that assumes
an article title and url has been planted in the rssFeedItem struct
(which is set as the user data for the entire parser) when it detects
that a item close tag has been read.  In that one situation, ProcessEndTag
calls the ParseArticle function, passing in the text that sits in
((rssNewsItem *)userData)->title and ((rssNewsItem *) userData)->url.

You're going to want to add stuff to the rssNewsItem struct--things like
hashsets and vectors--so that your stop words set and your set of indices
can be threaded through the expat parser and made available to your
ParseArticle function.
